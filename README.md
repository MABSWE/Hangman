## How to play Hangman

Welcome to Hangman! This is a simple implementation of the classic Battleship game in Python.


- Enter your letter guesses when prompted.
- The game will display the current state of the word, the letters guessed, and the hangman figure.
- If you correctly guess a letter, it will be revealed in the word.
- If you incorrectly guess a letter, the hangman figure will progress.
- The game ends when either you correctly guess the word or reach 7 incorrect guesses.
